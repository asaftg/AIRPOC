# System Overview

The system architecture for AIRPOC. This is the shared map — **each module owner
keeps their section current.** Read [Engineering Guidelines](ENGINEERING_GUIDELINES.md)
before contributing.

## Mission

Detect, track, and guide against small aerial targets (counter-UAS) and humans/vehicles (ground targets). A pan/tilt
seeker head carries the sensors; a Jetson-class compute module runs perception and
points the head at the target.

## Dataflow

```
  EO camera ──► detection ──► EO tracker ──┐
  Radar ──────► radar tracker ─────────────┼──► fusion ──► gimbal pointing ──► guidance
  Thermal (optional, later) ───────────────┘
    └── EO-blind fallback: radar tracker ──► gimbal ──► guidance, STANDALONE
  NIR illuminator ──(lights the EO scene, continuous)              (effector)
```

Each sensor produces detections and maintains its **own** tracks — the EO tracker
(`eotrack/`) for the camera, the radar daemon's built-in tracker for radar. Fusion
merges the per-sensor tracks into one target picture; the gimbal points the head at
the track; guidance steers an effector. The NIR illuminator is a sensing aid for the
EO camera, not a detection source.

**Radar-only is a required capability, not just an input.** In haze, smoke, or
with the EO camera dead, radar must **acquire, track, and guide on its own** —
the chain `radar → radar tracker → gimbal → guidance` has to run with no EO and no
fusion. That raises the bar on the radar module: it must deliver a *steerable*
target — accurate, bias-free azimuth/elevation and a stable bounding box the
gimbal can point at — not merely a cue for EO to refine. This is why box/angle
quality (not just detection) is the radar module's open work item.

The **operator console (`app/`) is the system's main process** and a **thin proxy**:
it consumes each sensor module's served feed (EO video, radar frames), forwards
operator commands to the module that owns them (zoom/AE/illuminator → EO; cluster cfg
→ radar; target-select for tracking; later, gimbal), and serves one integrated picture
to the operator's laptop over WiFi/USB/HM30. It does **no** capture/ISP/AE/encode — the
modules own their domains — and never sits in the control loop. A feed that is down
shows **NOT CONNECTED**; there is no synthetic data.

## Compute platform

NVIDIA **Jetson Orin Nano Super** — the compute for both bench and the production
seeker. Note it has no hardware video encoder (no NVENC), so any encoded video feed
is software MJPEG; the detector/tracker consumes frames on-device. Platform bring-up
— flashing, base config, cooling — is in [`jetson/`](../jetson/README.md).

## Modules

| Module | Owner | State | Chapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jetson platform | — | ✅ bring-up done | [`jetson/`](../jetson/README.md) |
| EO camera | — | ✅ 60 fps mono, AE, production C pipeline + preview | [`eo/`](../eo/README.md) |
| NIR illuminator | — | ✅ controller HW-verified + controls in the reviewer; camera-sync pending | [`illuminator/`](../illuminator/README.md) |
| Operator console (`app/`) | — | ✅ thin proxy console, running on the Jetson: relays EO video + radar/detector/**tracker** SSE, forwards controls, adds the radar scope + EO overlays + record/replay (native-HD 60 fps, Convert-to-HD, library/offload) + day/night. The **EO tracker is the single source of the EO boxes** (raw detector boxes = dev overlay); the **target list carries both sensors** (EO: class/confidence/angles · radar: range/speed), source-tagged and **not fused**; tapping a list row, EO box or radar circle **declares the tracked target** (MANUAL default). No capture/ISP/AE/encode. Reserved: gimbal pointing, BRG/RNG, BATT/ALT | [`app/`](../app/README.md) |
| Radar | `:8092` | ✅ V2 shipped 2026-07-11: crash-proof fw + guarded temporal tracker, 26 Hz / 0 drops, class-less boxes, GUI-consumed. Human ~300 m night / ~200 m day, vehicles radial ~424 m. Firmware `agv3` (2026-07-17): comb gate fixed and observing, awaiting calibration before arming. Open: 450-pt/frame chip budget ~420 full (half spent on threshold-level junk past 200 m) caps far range, tangential blindness (Phase 3), angle cal | [`radar/`](../radar/README.md) |
| Record & replay (`recorder/`) | `:8093` | 🟡 records the full mission (camera, radar, detections, all metadata) to the NVMe without slowing the live system, and replays it looking like the live screen — full-resolution native video (denoised, smoothly seekable H.264), radar scope + detection boxes in sync, pause/step/scrub. On-device with the real camera + radar: recording, native replay, per-session HD-convert, and offload/export all verified; browse/tag included. Next: console-side polish (native `<video>` playback + live-rate radar/det replay streams) | [`recorder/`](../recorder/README.md) |
| Detection | — | 🟡 EO detector live on `:8094` — TensorRT model (native 1440×1088) that **collects faint evidence over several frames before reporting**, so a distant target the model only half-recognises still gets reported, while confident ones go out immediately and unchanged. One box per target, feeding the console. Stock off-the-shelf placeholder model (FP16 ~20 ms / INT8 ~14.7 ms on-device); trained mono model + accuracy pending. **Running on the Jetson and measured live** (adds no compute: 22.73 ms vs 22.68 ms with it off). CPU motion worker **frozen** | [`detection/`](../detection/README.md) |
| EO tracker (`eotrack/`) | `:8095` | ✅ live on the Jetson beside the detector: turns the detector's per-frame boxes into persistent, smoothed, coasted tracks with **stable IDs**, and serves them as an angle-domain track stream that **mirrors the radar tracker's wire** so fusion joins both the same way. Stare mode plus an operator-engaged **60 fps camera-rate lock** (`airpoc.eo_y10`). Owns identity/smoothing/coasting; **not** weak-evidence integration (the detector's) nor rejecting the model's persistent false positives (a better model's). Open: velocity-gated association for the crossing-vehicle ID-swap | [`eotrack/`](../eotrack/README.md) |
| Training data (`datasets/`) | — | 🟡 offline bench pipeline (Python; never runs on the seeker): FPV-strike footage → COCO vehicle/human set for the EO detector. Architecture + non-GPU spine unit-tested on a synthetic fixture; **the real-data stages have never been run** | [`datasets/`](../datasets/README.md) |
| Fusion | — | ⬜ not started — joins the EO + radar track streams into one target, assigns the global id, adds range | — |
| Gimbal | — | ⬜ not started | — |
| Guidance | — | ⬜ not started | — |

### EO camera (done)
Waveshare IMX296-130 (Sony IMX296, mono global shutter) on the Jetson via a custom
`nv_imx296` driver. Streams **Y10 mono 1440×1088 @ 60 fps** with working
exposure/gain. The shipping datapath is C (`eo/pipeline/`): capture → flicker-free
AE → ISP → detector hook, plus the **preview** (browser: stats overlay,
digital zoom, focus assist, illuminator controls). The earlier Python bench tools
(`eo/tools/`) were retired once the C pipeline superseded them. Global shutter
(no rolling-shutter skew) suits fast-moving targets. Detail:
[`eo/README.md`](../eo/README.md).

### NIR illuminator (controls done; continuous-on)
SG-IR850-8M 850 nm illuminator with motor zoom over TTL UART; C controller +
`sgctl` CLI, **HW-verified**. On/off, drive power, and beam-FOV controls are **live
in the EO preview** (`eo/pipeline/`, via the illuminator shim) and in the operator
console. Purpose: light the EO scene so exposure can be short enough to freeze a
moving target. The fitted device is **continuous-on — its protocol has no strobe
or trigger command** — so pulsing in step with the exposure needs a custom
illuminator and is not planned for this unit.
[`NIR_SYNC.md`](../illuminator/docs/NIR_SYNC.md) describes that future path; note
it covers a separate NIR sensor board, not this flashlight. Detail:
[`illuminator/`](../illuminator/README.md).

### Operator console (`app/`) — main process, a proxy (running on the Jetson)
The field GUI and the system's main process — a **thin proxy** that consumes the sensor
modules' feeds and adds the integrated picture. It does **no capture/ISP/AE/encode/
illuminator-serial**; each module owns its domain and the app couples to its served
contract only (so an EO/radar/detector refactor doesn't break it).

- **EO:** `app/eo_client.c` consumes the EO module's MJPEG feed (`eo/pipeline`, `:8091`),
  relays the video on `/stream`, mirrors its `/stats`, and forwards zoom/AE/gain/exposure/
  illuminator to its `/ctl`. The EO module owns the camera, ISP, AE, and the illuminator.
- **Radar:** `app/radar_client.c` consumes the radar daemon's SSE (`:8092`), serves it
  verbatim on `/radar` + `/radar/stream` per
  [`radar/docs/INTEGRATION.md`](../radar/docs/INTEGRATION.md), and forwards the ten tracker
  knobs (incl. the elevation gate).
- **Detector:** `app/det_client.c` consumes the detection daemon's SSE (`:8094`), re-broadcasts
  boxes on `/det/stream`, and forwards `det_*` knobs. Human/vehicle model boxes + motion-only
  movers are drawn over the video.
- **Record / replay:** the recorder daemon (`:8093`) is proxied at `/rec/*`. REC records; the
  LIBRARY browses/edits/deletes/offloads; replay reuses the live renderers. Native-HD 60 fps
  replay streams the recorder's cached `native.mp4` (state-driven, auto-plays when built, never
  rebuilds on entry) with a per-clip Convert-to-HD action.
- **Console-only:** the radar scope render, EO + detector overlays, tracking target-selection
  (AUTO = most important: fused → nearer → confidence; MANUAL = tap), and styling/day-night.

Serves over `/stats` + `/stream` (MJPEG) + `/radar`,`/det` (SSE) + `GET /ctl` + `/rec/*` — no
websockets, no CDN, assets sent `no-store`. A feed that is down shows **NOT CONNECTED** (no
synthetic data). Detail + endpoints:
[`app/README.md`](../app/README.md) · [`app/docs/GUI.md`](../app/docs/GUI.md).

### Radar (V2 shipped 2026-07-11; comb gate + crossing traffic open)
TI **AWR2944PEVM** (77 GHz, 4TX/4RX), **no DCA** — data is the mmw_demo TLV
point cloud over UART. The C daemon (`radar/src/`) pushes the A/G long-range
profile, parses the stream drop-free, runs a **temporal multi-target tracker**
(class-less boxes: M-of-N confirm, post-confirm consistency guard, coast,
park-hold), and serves SSE on `:8092` — consumed by the operator console
(`app/radar_client.c`). **V2** = crash-proof firmware (a point-flood frame is
deferred + counted instead of bricking the chip — field-verified), 16.0 dB
CFAR / compression 0.75 cfg, and the guard that killed the wandering-ghost
bug. **Measured:** human ~300 m night-quiet / ~200 m day-busy, vehicle radial
echoes ~424 m; 26 Hz / 0 drops (DSP-bound — see
[`radar/docs/FRAMERATE.md`](../radar/docs/FRAMERATE.md)). **Open:** the fw's
DDMA comb gate doesn't activate at runtime (RCA in progress; junk points
~250/frame until fixed); crossing traffic is Doppler-blind (Phase-3 on-chip
angle-motion detector, spec written); per-unit antenna cal for the angle
accuracy that standalone EO-blind guidance needs. Versions + plan:
[`radar/docs/ROADMAP.md`](../radar/docs/ROADMAP.md). GUI contract:
[`radar/docs/INTEGRATION.md`](../radar/docs/INTEGRATION.md). Detail:
[`radar/`](../radar/README.md).

### Record & replay (`recorder/`) — on-device; EO+radar+detection recording live, native replay working
Standalone C daemon (`:8093`, systemd `airpoc-recorder`) recording every
channel to crash-safe AIREC sessions on the NVMe (`/data/recordings`, ext4
`AIRPOC-DATA`, provisioned by `jetson/nvme/`): native Y10 (10-bit packed,
lossless), the display JPEGs the operator saw, bit-perfect radar UART bytes +
frame JSON, the EO detector frames, and 5 Hz stats/events. Producers publish to
overwrite-oldest shm taps and are never blocked; a recorder fault cannot touch a
sensor pipeline. HW-verified: 30-min full-rate soak @ ~125 MB/s with 0 drops,
kill-9 recovery to CRC-valid prefixes, recorder CPU ~10% of one core. **EO,
radar, and detection taps are all live** — real missions record camera (full-res
native + the display view), radar, detections, and metadata, and replay
end-to-end today. Replay re-serves recorded data through the same endpoint shapes
the console polls (any channel mix; a video-less session replays scope + stats),
with play/pause/0.5–4×/seek/frame-step; native full-resolution replay is a
bitrate-capped, keyframed, **grain-denoised** H.264 the console plays as a
`<video>` (seekable past 2 GB), with the radar scope and detection boxes streamed
at the recorded rate on the same timeline. Sessions can be **converted to a
shareable HD movie** on demand (persistent background encode, one at a time; a
per-session `hd` flag drives the console badge) and **offloaded** as a streaming
`.tar`. Remaining: console-side polish — native `<video>` playback and consuming
the live-rate radar/detection replay streams. Detail:
[`recorder/`](../recorder/README.md).

### Detection (`detection/`) — EO object detector that collects evidence over frames
On-device detector (`detectiond`, `:8094`) that reads the EO camera tap
(`airpoc.eo_y10`) and emits per-frame `human`/`vehicle`/`drone` boxes over
`/stream` + `/stats` + `/ctl`, plus the `airpoc.det_wire` recorder tap — the same
contract shape as the radar daemon; the console already consumes it. A **TensorRT
appearance model** at native 1440×1088 (RTMDet-tiny, Apache; raw-head export with
decode + NMS in our C++) feeds a **temporal integrator**. Boxes carry pixels **and**
real-world angle (via the lens IFOV) for fusion.

**Collecting evidence over frames (v0.6.0).** A confidence threshold throws away everything
below it, permanently — a person far enough away that the model only ever half-recognises
them, scoring 0.2 on every frame, is discarded on every frame, and nothing downstream can
get them back. Simply lowering the threshold instead would let in every one-frame flicker.
So the detector runs the model at a **low floor**, follows each faint candidate from frame
to frame, and reports it once it has shown up consistently in roughly the same place
(flagged `"tbd":1`). Anything the model is already confident about goes out **immediately
and unchanged, with no added delay**. Every box leaves through one place, so nothing is
reported twice, and a reported box is always one the model really produced — never a guess.
Boxes carry how long the evidence has been building (`age`, `hits`) and how far the target
has travelled in a straight line (`disp`), i.e. whether it is moving or holding still —
useful to fusion and for cross-checking against radar, which only sees movers. It is **not**
a real/false signal: parked vehicles and standing people are targets and barely move.

On a 30 s daytime street the plain 0.50 threshold reported 3.5 boxes per tick and **not one
person**; with collection on, 17.7 boxes per tick and people found, with the confident boxes
identical either way. Most of what was added is real — parked cars the threshold had been
discarding. **Running on the Jetson**, where the A/B measured 22.73 ms with collection off vs 22.68 ms on — it adds no compute.

> **Pitfall — the detector is no longer "stateless".** It used to emit one fresh, independent
> list of boxes per frame, with all cross-frame work left to the EO tracker. That is no
> longer true and cannot be: evidence has to be collected *before* the threshold or it is
> already gone. Identity, smoothing, coasting, occlusion and re-acquisition stay with the
> tracker, and **the tracker should read `age`/`hits`/`disp` rather than redo this work.**
> Note what is *nobody's* job downstream: a persistent false positive (a hedge the model
> calls a vehicle every frame) is maximally consistent and therefore invisible to any
> temporal test. Only a better model removes it.

> **Pitfall — collecting evidence strengthens the model's mistakes too.** A hedge the model
> calls a vehicle at 0.3 on every frame is indistinguishable from a real car at 0.3 on every
> frame. Only a better model separates them, which is why the stock placeholder is the real
> bottleneck. Related: `tbd_lo` decides how much is accepted, `tbd_frames` only how long a
> faint target waits; and `disp` can pick up a neighbour's history, so identity stays the
> tracker's job.

> **🧊 The CPU motion worker is FROZEN** and off by default. It swallowed targets that move
> slowly or pause, missed slow distant ones, and drowned breezy scenes in wind-blown foliage
> — real motion that no threshold removes without also removing distant targets. It is
> **frozen, not deleted**, for one reason: collecting evidence rescues a target the model
> *half* sees, but not one it does not see at all (a drone a few pixels across), and motion
> is the only path that would ever catch that. Revive only on evidence.

Measured on-device (warm GPU, native res): FP16 ~20.8 ms / INT8 ~14.7 ms; the model is near
its floor for this chip, and the biggest lever on live latency is pinning the GPU clocks (a
`jetson/` boot service). The frame-to-frame collection itself costs nothing measurable.
**The current model is a stock, off-the-shelf placeholder** proving the pipeline; our trained
mono model does **not** yet drop in unchanged. Detail:
[`detection/README.md`](../detection/README.md) ·
[`detection/docs/INTEGRATION.md`](../detection/docs/INTEGRATION.md).

### EO tracker (`eotrack/`) — the temporal layer over the EO detector (live on the Jetson)
Standalone C daemon (`trackerd`, `:8095`) that consumes the detector's SSE `/stream`
(`:8094`) and turns its per-frame boxes into **persistent tracks with stable IDs** —
confirming a target over a few frames before it earns an id, smoothing its position,
coasting it through short gaps, and dropping one-frame flicker. It serves the tracks on
`/stream` + `/stats` + `/ctl` and publishes the `airpoc.trk_wire` recorder tap — the same
contract shape as the radar daemon. The wire is **angle-domain** (azimuth/elevation via the
lens, raw sensor frame) and **mirrors the radar tracker's target wire**, so fusion consumes
both sensors the same way; EO has no range, so it carries a size-growth (looming) cue instead.

Two modes: **stare** (default) tracks everything the detector reports; **track** (operator
`engage=<tid>`) adds a **60 fps camera-rate lock** on the raw frames (`airpoc.eo_y10`),
re-anchored by each detection, so guidance gets az/el at camera rate with a few ms latency.
The tracker only reports *where the target is* — it writes no other module's `/ctl`; keeping
the target framed (zoom, exposure, illuminator, radar FOV) is each sensor module's own job
off the engaged-target wire.

What it does **not** do, on purpose (see the detector pitfalls above): it does not raise weak
evidence above the threshold (the detector does that *before* the threshold, and the tracker
reads the detector's `age`/`hits`/`tbd` instead of redoing it), and it **cannot** reject the
model's persistent false positives — a box the model draws on the same hedge every frame is
rock-steady and invisible to any temporal test; only a better model removes it. It never
drops a track for holding still, so parked vehicles and standing/prone people stay.

**Live on the Jetson 2026-07-21**, running beside the detector, both feeds connected, holding
vehicle tracks with stable IDs. **Open work:** the crossing-vehicle **ID-swap** (when a car
passes a parked car their ids can trade) — the fix is velocity-gated association plus a longer
park-hold, to be tuned on the live feed rather than a recorded clip.

**Console side (done, not yet run end-to-end):** the console consumes `/trk/stream` and draws
its `tracks[]` as **the** EO boxes — the raw detector boxes moved to a dev overlay, which is
what removes the double display. The **target list carries both sensors**, source-tagged and
**not fused**: EO rows show class/confidence/angles, radar rows show range/speed, keyed
`"<src>:<tid>"` so the two id spaces cannot collide. Selecting a target on **any** surface
(list row, EO box, radar circle) declares the tracked state — an EO pick sends
`trk_engage=<tid>`, and `mode`/`engaged` are reflected from the tracker's wire rather than the
button press. The launcher starts `trackerd` after `detectiond` and stops it with the stack.

[`eotrack/docs/INTEGRATION.md`](../eotrack/docs/INTEGRATION.md) ·
[`app/docs/GUI.md`](../app/docs/GUI.md).

### Fusion / Gimbal / Guidance (not started)
Stubs for the module owners to fill. Each should add: purpose, hardware/interfaces,
current state, and a link to its module folder. (Tracking target *selection* lives in
`app/` today; the per-sensor **trackers already exist** — EO in `eotrack/`, radar built into
the radar daemon — so fusion's job is to join their two track streams into one target, assign
the global id, and add range. It consumes each tracker's `age`/`hits`/`disp` and the
size-growth cue rather than recomputing them.)

## Maturity

What each module has been **proven** to do — by evidence, not judgement. Three
states, each one a checkable claim:

- **Field-verified** — run on the real hardware, outdoors, against real targets,
  with a date and a recording to point at.
- **Bench-verified** — runs on the real hardware on the bench.
- **Unrun** — the code exists (and may be unit-tested) but has never been
  executed end to end on real inputs.

A row sits at the highest state its **recorded evidence** supports. Several rows
below are probably field-verified in practice and are marked bench-verified only
because no date or session id is written down anywhere. Upgrading a row means
adding that evidence — not relabelling it.

| Module | State | Evidence on record | Biggest known gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jetson platform | Bench-verified | JetPack 6.2.2 / L4T r36.4.4 on P3767-0005, MAXN_SUPER, fan pinned | `install_clocks.sh` / `install_fan.sh` install from `/tmp`, so the documented bring-up does not run on a fresh box; NVMe and WiFi-AP provisioning are missing from the bring-up sequence |
| EO camera | Bench-verified | Y10 mono 1440×1088 @ 60 fps on-device with working exposure/gain | the night denoiser cannot engage at defaults — its gate needs applied gain ≥ 200 while the AE cap is 120; no measured low-light image-quality figures |
| NIR illuminator | Bench-verified | on/off, power, beam FOV and status confirmed against the real device 2026-07-01 | no udev rule, so commands go to the first USB-serial adapter to enumerate; commands are fire-and-forget with no state readback |
| Operator console (`app/`) | Bench-verified | runs on the Jetson, relays EO + radar + detector + recorder, record/replay exercised on-device | the deploy procedure is written down nowhere in the repo, including the `web_assets.h` regeneration trap. **The tracker integration (EO boxes from `/trk/stream`, merged target list, selection→engage) is built and compiles but has NOT been run against a live `trackerd`** — the box went unreachable before the end-to-end check |
| Radar | Field-verified | V2 field-verified 2026-07-11; human ~300 m night / ~200 m day, vehicles radial ~424 m ([`radar/`](../radar/README.md)) | which firmware image is on the chip is recorded inconsistently across the radar docs; angle accuracy for EO-blind standalone guidance |
| Record & replay | Bench-verified | 30-min full-rate soak at ~125 MB/s with 0 drops; kill-9 recovery to CRC-valid prefixes | that soak has no session id, date or log to point at, and no reproduction procedure |
| Detection | Bench-verified | on-device latency FP16 ~20.8 ms / INT8 ~14.7 ms; verified correct on one known image | **no accuracy figures at all** — no mAP, no false-positive rate, no DRI ranges; and a trained 3-class model does not currently load |
| Training data (`datasets/`) | **Unrun** | the non-GPU spine unit-tested against a synthetic fixture | every stage that touches real data has never executed |
| EO tracker (`eotrack/`) | Bench-verified | live on the Jetson beside the detector 2026-07-21, both feeds connected, holding vehicle tracks with stable IDs; offline replay + lock/ego unit tests pass (`make check`) | no field run yet; the crossing-vehicle ID-swap is unfixed (velocity-gated association pending). Console overlay + launcher wiring now DONE (tracker is the console's EO box source; `trackerd` in START/STOP) but not yet run end-to-end on the box |
| Fusion / gimbal / guidance | Not started | — | — |
