# AIRPOC — Airborne-target Interception Proof of Concept

AIRPOC is the FAZE head one-way-attack aerial proof of concept: it
**detects, tracks, and guides against small aerial targets (A/A), humans and vehicles (A/G)**. A pan/tilt seeker
head carries the sensors; the compute stack turns their data into a track and
points the head (and, later, an effector) at the target.

## What the system does (plain English)

```

- **EO camera** — visible mono global-shutter imaging (this repo's camera bring-up).
- **NIR illuminator** — pulsed near-IR light so the EO camera can see and freeze
  motion in low light.
- **Radar** — range/velocity detection, all-weather, day/night; the **EO-blind fallback**: must acquire/track/guide **standalone** when EO is hazed or dead (see [System Overview](docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) dataflow).
- **Detection** — find candidate targets in each sensor stream.
- **Fusion** — combine EO + thermal + radar into one target picture.
- **Tracking** — maintain target state over time.
- **Gimbal** — point the seeker head at the track (pan/tilt).
- **Guidance** — steer an effector / interceptor toward the target.

## Status (high level)

| Module | State |
|---|---|
| Jetson platform bring-up | ✅ flashed, MAXN, fan pinned — see [`jetson/`](jetson/README.md) |
| EO camera | ✅ Y10 mono @ 60 fps, focused, auto-exposed; **production C pipeline + preview** (zoom/focus/illuminator controls) — see [`eo/`](eo/README.md) |
| NIR illuminator | ✅ controller HW-verified **+ on/off·power·beam-FOV controls live in the EO reviewer**; camera-sync (NIR strobe) pending — see [`illuminator/`](illuminator/README.md) |
| Operator console (`app/`) | 🟡 thin **proxy** console + main process: consumes the EO video feed + radar SSE, forwards controls, adds the **radar scope**, EO overlays, **tracking auto/manual**, **illuminator** (forwarded to the EO feed), bright day/night. No capture/ISP/AE/encode. NOT CONNECTED when a feed is down — see [`app/`](app/README.md) |
| Radar | ✅ AWR2944P (no DCA) **C daemon + PPI previewer**, **HW-verified: 26 Hz, 0 dropped frames**, per-point SNR live; drop-free parse → range-adaptive DBSCAN → **class-less boxes** with 6 live `/ctl` knobs; **consumed by the console** (`app/radar_client.c` ← `:8092`); chip DSP timing in `/stats` (~1.9% CPU). Box/angle optimization for EO-blind **standalone guidance** = known future work — see [`radar/`](radar/README.md) |
| Record & replay (`recorder/`) | 🟡 standalone C daemon on `:8093` (systemd, deployed), **HW-verified on the NVMe: ~125 MB/s, 0 drops, kill-9-safe AIREC sessions, recorder CPU ~10% of one core**; library + timeline replay live. **Radar taps ✅ live** (real sessions recording + replaying today); pending: EO taps ([`recorder/docs/TAP.md`](recorder/docs/TAP.md)) + console UI ([`recorder/docs/GUI_INTEGRATION.md`](recorder/docs/GUI_INTEGRATION.md)) — see [`recorder/`](recorder/README.md) |
| Detection, fusion, tracking, gimbal, guidance | ⬜ not started |
